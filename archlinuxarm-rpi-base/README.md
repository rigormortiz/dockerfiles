### Info
This is an Archlinux for Raspberry Pi image with nothing extra in it. It should run on all models of the Raspberry Pi 2 and 3, including the 3 B+. It mainly pulls the monthly bootstrap, verifies the SHA1 sum, sets some defaults, and cleans up some extra things that are in the base image.

On it's own, this image does nothing. It needs to be used as a base for more interesting things. It is designed to be built on the Pi itself.
